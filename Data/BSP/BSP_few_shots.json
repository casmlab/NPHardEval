If the target value is greater than the middle element, the search continues on the right side of the array. This process is repeated until the target value is found or the search space is empty.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process for the given array and target value:\n\n1. The middle element of the array is 30. The target value 36 is greater than 30, so the search continues on the right side of the array.\n2. The new array is 31, 36, 38, 43, 55. The middle element is 38. The target value 36 is less than 38, so the search continues on the left side of the array.\n3. The new array is 31, 36. The middle element is 31. The target value 36 is greater than 31, so the search continues on the right side of the array.\n4. The new array is 36. The middle element is 36, which is equal to the target value. So, the position of 36 in the original array is found.\n\n</reasoning>\n<final_answer>{'Position': '7'}</final_answer>\n</root>",

If the middle element is less than the target, we know the target must be in the right half of the array. If the middle element is greater than the target, we know the target must be in the left half of the array. We repeat this process, halving the search space each time, until we find the target or determine that it is not in the array.\n\nHere are the steps of the search process:\n1. The middle element of the array is 46. This is greater than the target value 6, so we know the target must be in the left half of the array.\n2. The middle element of the left half of the array is 16. This is greater than the target value 6, so we know the target must be in the left half of this sub-array.\n3. The middle element of this sub-array is 6, which is the target value. So, we have found the target.\n</reasoning>\n<final_answer>{'Position': '1'}</final_answer>\n</root>",
